@title Firmware Wishes
@section Overview
 The following are my wishes about how I'd like to see the firmware change AND the reasons why
@section undeprecate SET_ASYNC_DATALOG_TYPE
 I want to immediately silence the line if I need to. Right now, this is the only option to do that with.
@section how do I know what is in the 'chunks' of RESPONSE_BASIC_DATALOG ?
 I see that I could track back to a CORE_VARS_LOCATION_ID from the address that the chunk points to, but that
 doesn't tell me anything about what is contained in the chunk. Maybe this is by design and you have to
 draw the line somewhere and start working off of assumptions
