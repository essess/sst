@title detect.exe
@section Overview
A simple app to enumerate all connected FTDI devices. Useful for quick troubleshooting or device examination.
 If you don't know the serial number or description of the device you want to connect to, this is a good way
 to pick one. The other apps in this suite usually use the serial number (or description) as an identifier
 to connect against.
@section Operation
None. Start the app and it kicks off a discovery sequence and displays the result. The title bar indicates the
 number of devices found and you can dig deeper by clicking on any of the '+' signs to open or close the desired
 node. Plug/unplug events also (re)start a device search.
@section Weirdness
The FTDI drivers are not threadsafe during search sequences. This is the reason searching takes such a long time after
 a plug/unplug event. Sometimes the driver returns empty serial numbers and descriptions while capabilities are assesed
 or another process opens the device. If a device is not getting discovered make sure you haven't already opened it in
 another process; some software configurations also return empty strings in this scenario (but not all, you may get lucky).
