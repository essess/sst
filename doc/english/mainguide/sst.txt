@title SST - essess tuner suite

@section Philosophy
I have some restrictions I've placed on this project and myself (not in any particular order):
  @indent
  1] Windows platform @linebreak
  2] PureBasic ecosystem - if it doesn't already exist, I roll my own. @linebreak
  3] BSD license @linebreak
  @endindent
Windows is simply the largest platform in common use. Yeah, @internetlink "http://purebasic.com/" "PureBasic" is
 crossplatform but I'm not going to bother unless the demand is there or someone is willing to pay. PB is more
 verbose than I care for, but it has tons of built-in libraries to leverage. I can also generate native x86/x64
 applications and dll's.

I already know that once code goes up in a repo for people to examine, there is nothing in this world to keep them
 from taking and rolling it into their own private codebases. I simply make my stuff BSD in the hopes that I get to
 see where it ends up. I'm not sure if I'll accept code contributions, but @referencelink "freq" "feature requests"
 are @bold always welcome. Since you're using it, let me know the direction you'd like to see it go.
